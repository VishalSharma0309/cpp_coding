/* 
Binary Search Tree
- A type of Binary Tree inspired from Binary Search (O(logn))
- suppose you're searching for 's'. We start the search from root 'r'
    - if r==s -> found
    - else if r>s -> seach in right sub-tree
    - else search in left sub-tree

- Properties of BST:
    1. For every node 'n': 
        everyting left to n is smaller than n->data
        everything right to n is greater than n->data
